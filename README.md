# Crystals-Collector Game

This is an interactive web browsers game that dynamically updates the HTML with the jQuery library.

# Here's how to play the game
1. You will be given a Target Score at the start of the game. 
2. There are four crystals below. By clicking on the crystals, you will add the numbers until you get to the Target Score that was given. FYI, you won't know the number of each crystal. 
3. You will win if ```Your Score``` matches with the ```Target Score```.
4. You will lose if ```Your Score``` reaches a value that is higher than the ```Target Score```.
5. The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
6. When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values.
7. The app will show the number of games the player wins and loses.
